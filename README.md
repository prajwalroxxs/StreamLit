Titanic Survival Predictor
A simple machine learning web app built using Streamlit and a Random Forest Classifier to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.

Overview
This app uses the Titanic dataset from Seaborn, processes key features (pclass, sex, age, sibsp, parch, fare), and trains a model to predict survival (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).
Users can interactively enter passenger details and receive real-time predictions.
